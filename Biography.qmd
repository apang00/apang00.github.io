My name is Yi Fei Pang, but I usually go by Alex. I am currently a fourth year
student at the University of Toronto Mississauga majoring in GIS an minoring
in statistics and computer science. I will be graduating this Summer and 
hopefully be able to find something that aligns with my field of study. But 
first, I have to pass this class...

Outside of school and work, I like to exercise a lot. I would go to my local 
recreation centre to play basketball and use the gyms there for weights. On
days that I feel lazier, I would stay home and play Smash Bros. or go to my
friends' house for NBA 2K. On days that I feel lucky, I would play cards online
or with my friends or bet on an NBA game.


Thanks for checking out my Bio!
